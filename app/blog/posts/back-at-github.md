I was on GitHub from April 2022 until September 2023. I loved working there, not only for being **GitHub**, but also because I was working directly with the Brazilian tech community, something I am quite passionated about. It lasted only 18 months because of internal policies issues (At the time GH couldn't keep a contractor for longer than that). I was sad to go, but _c'est la vie_.

From there I looked for another great job, found some, but nothing that I enjoyed quite as much, so I did a bit of everything: managing DevRel for a small Open Source project, working internally as DevEx in a big company, doing tech events for a fintech, consulting for companies wanting to get started in Developer Relations... I even did social media for a startup for some time.Suddenly, over a year had passed and I was still looking for something...

In December I thought I had found it! But then GitHub reached out asking if I would be interested in coming back for a year! It was a tough choice. Like, you just meet this new cute guy but that one ex you never really got over wats you back LOL This is not supposed to be a romance, but I guess I do read waaay too many of those and it is showing in my writing ðŸ˜… (Maybe I could start a GitHub romance series of blog postsðŸ˜‚)

Anyways, it took a while (silly bureaucracy) but I am back at GitHub. It is weird because it feels good to be back but at the same time, it feels new. I have a new manager and a new team structure. I am somehow not sure in how to get start on a job that I used to do lol But don't worry, I already have a brainstorm doc for that.

I hope to have a big impact on the tech scene Brazil and maybe they will figure out how to let me stay fora while ðŸ˜‰ #goals

Let's see if I will keep up with blogging, sharing what I am up to as a Dev Advocate.
